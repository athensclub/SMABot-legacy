# SMABot
The codebase for current version of SMABot. See https://top.gg/bot/720319549685235732 <br/>
Note: The bot is currently unusable because the hosting service for this project (heroku) discontinues a free plan, but the development of the new version is under way, although the author does not have much time, so don't get any high expectation :P

# Author
The only author for this project is [me](https://github.com/athensclub) (Kawin Rattanapun)
